## What is Reason

In my understanding Reason is supposed to be an ecosystem (language, tools, documentaions, libraries) on top of such a great langauge that is OCaml.

Here's a few more explanantions:

> Reason is an umbrella project that provides a curated layer for OCaml. It offers:
A new, familiar syntax for the battle-tested language that is OCaml.
A workflow for compiling to JavaScript and native code.
A set of friendly documentations, libraries and utilities.

> Reason is a new frontend and developer experience built on the OCaml programming language. The goal of Reason is to harness the decades of research that went into OCaml and extend its reach to all kinds of developers.

## Why Reason

- World class pattern matching
- Excellent type inference
- Bare metal compilation without a VM, but alternatively the ability to compile into JS
- Great predictable performance, even without a ton of performance optimizations (because the runtime is so simple)
